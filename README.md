## Project Description 

<p align="justify">
  
This project is the solution to an exercise proposed by a professor at my college, where I use the concept of backtracking to help a mouse reach a cheese through a maze  <br>
</p>

## Funcionalities

:heavy_check_mark: Use backtracking to solve a maze

:heavy_check_mark: Know if it is impossible to solve the maze

:heavy_check_mark: Show the steps the Rat took to reach the cheese 

:heavy_check_mark: Be able to change the size and obstacles of the maze

## How it works
 <p>
The backtracking algorithm, in conjunction with stacks, solves complex problems by exploring all possible solutions in an organized and efficient way. Imagine a labyrinth, where each path taken opens up a range of possibilities.

Start with an empty stack: The stack is clean, ready to be filled with your choices.

Explore Options: Analyze the problem and identify the first decisions to be made. Each option becomes a card in the pile, stacked in the order you consider them.

Move along the Chosen Path: Based on the top card of the pile (the last choice made), take the necessary actions to advance the problem.

Check if you reached your destination: Did you reach the desired solution? If so, congratulations! You have successfully resolved the issue. If not, proceed to the next step.

Explore Alternatives or Return:
New Options: If there are still unexplored possibilities within the current path, add them to the pile as new cards. Keep exploring, stacking your cards, and moving forward on the problem.
Dead End Path: If there are no more valid options on the current path, it's time to turn back. Remove the top card from the pile (the last choice that did not lead to the solution) and return to the previous decision point.
Repeat until You Find the Solution or Exhaust Options: Continue repeating the steps until you find the desired solution or until all alternatives in the stack are exhausted. <br>
